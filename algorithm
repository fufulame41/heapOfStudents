Include Necessary Imports:
Include <iostream>, <fstream>, <sstream>, <vector>, <string>, and "student.h".
Declare functions to load students, print students, show student names, find a student, delete students, and present a menu.
Main Function:
Create a vector of Student pointers named students.
Define a filename students.csv.
Call loadStudents to populate the vector from the CSV file.
Use a while loop to present a menu and get the user's choice.
Execute appropriate actions based on the user's choice:
If the choice is "1", call showStudentNames.
If the choice is "2", call printStudents.
If the choice is "3", call findStudent.
If the choice is invalid, prompt the user to select a valid option.
After the loop, call delStudents to clean up the vector before exiting.
Function Implementations:
loadStudents:
Open the CSV file.
For each line of the file:
Create a Student instance on the heap.
Initialize that instance with the string from the CSV file.
Append that instance to the vector.
Close the file.
printStudents:
Iterate through each student in the vector.
Call printStudent method of each student.
Print a separator line for readability.
showStudentNames:
Iterate through each student in the vector.
Print the last and first names of each student.
findStudent:
Prompt the user to enter a last name.
Iterate through each student in the vector.
Check if the student's last name matches the input.
If a match is found, print the student's full data.
delStudents:
Iterate through each student in the vector.
Delete each student object to free up memory.
menu:
Present a menu with options to the user.
Read the user's choice and return it.
