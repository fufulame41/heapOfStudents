the three classes that i ended up using were address, date and student
the adddress class is going to hold the addresses of each of the students as plain text
the date class is where i keep the grad dates and birth dates of each of the students
the students class is where i will be appending the dates and addresses to
each class will have a .h and .cpp file for them
the functions i will have on my main file are quit, print all names, print all data, and find a student
